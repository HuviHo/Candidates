# Candidates
This project tracks potential candidates for an upcoming course. 
The user can add a new canidate with their basic information and notes about the candidate.
When a user is added their status is marked as pending. Their status can then be updated as either confirmed or declined. 
The user can view separate lists of all pending, confirmed or declined candidates. 
All candidates names are links which redirect the user to that candidates specific information. 

This project uses AJAX, Entity Framework, Viewbag, and a login system.
